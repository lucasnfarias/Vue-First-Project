# first-project

**Description:** my first project with Vue.js. Here is my first try with this framework. I tried to leard the basics like "states" (yeah... i'm used to React rsrs), routes, life cycles (React again), syntax,  etc. I developed two pages for this project. The first one is a simple comment list which is persisted through localStorage. And the second page retrives data from Github's API about my profile (I used Axios to make the HTTP request) and shows it on the screen (Model to View). Ooww, I almost forgot... in this project I used vue-styled-components since I really like developing css with js together plus all it's perks. That is all, folks. See ya!
